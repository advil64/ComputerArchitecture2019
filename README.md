# Computer Architecture Fall 2019
Rutgers CS211 with Professor Santosh Nagarakatte Fall 2019

This course covers materials to illustrate how a high level program is converted to binary and is eventually executed by the hardware. We will cover a brief introduction to programming in C, how data and control represented in C is converted to binary and how the binary code is executed by the processor. This will involve programming in C, understanding and debugging X86 assembly, interfaces between the hardware and the software components, organization of hardware and how the various components interact.
